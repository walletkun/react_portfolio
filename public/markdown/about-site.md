## üñ•Ô∏è About This Site

This portfolio is inspired by the macOS design language from [macOS Big Sur](https://www.apple.com/in/macos/big-sur/) and [Catalina](https://www.apple.com/bw/macos/catalina/), featuring a desktop-like interface for showcasing my work in a fun and interactive way.

It was built using modern web technologies including:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for building the UI
- [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) for state management
- [UnoCSS](https://uno.antfu.me/) for utility-first styling

Icons are styled and generated with the help of [sindresorhus/file-icon-cli](https://github.com/sindresorhus/file-icon-cli).

This site is deployed via [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), and the original source code that inspired this project can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Renovamen/playground-macos), created by [@Renovamen](https://github.com/Renovamen). Huge thanks to **@Renovamen** for making this incredible open-source project available.
